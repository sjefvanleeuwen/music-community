# Frontend Architecture

## UI Components
The frontend will use native Web Components based on the HTMLElement interface. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Framework Independence**: Components work without requiring any particular framework
- **Future-Proof**: Based on web standards that will remain compatible
- **Performance**: Lighter weight than many framework-based solutions
- **Encapsulation**: Shadow DOM provides strong encapsulation of styles and markup

### Component Structure
Each component will follow a consistent pattern with separate files:
- A TypeScript class (`.ts`) that extends HTMLElement
- A separate HTML template file (`.html`) for component markup
- A dedicated CSS file (`.css`) for component styling
- Files grouped by component in dedicated folders
- Lifecycle methods (connectedCallback, disconnectedCallback, etc.)
- Shadow DOM for encapsulation
- Custom events for communication between components

### File Organization
Components will follow this file structure:

### Core Components
1. **AppHeader**: Navigation and branding
2. **MusicPlayer**: Audio playback with playlist functionality
3. **StemPlayer**: Specialized player for stem playback and mixing
4. **UploadManager**: Drag-and-drop file uploading with progress
5. **MusicBrowser**: Search and filter music catalog
6. **EventCalendar**: Display of upcoming shows and events
7. **RatingModule**: Star ratings and review submission
8. **GenreTreeSelector**: Hierarchical genre selection interface with expandable tree
9. **InstrumentPicker**: Detailed instrument classification UI
10. **BlogPost**: Article display with rich content
11. **ContactForm**: User interaction and messaging
12. **UserProfile**: Account management interface
13. **AttributionDisplay**: Shows original work and stem sources for remixes
14. **RelationshipGraph**: Visualizes connections between original works and derivatives

## State Management
A lightweight state management solution will maintain application state:

- **Store Pattern**: Central source of truth for application state
- **Observable Data**: Components can subscribe to state changes
- **Action Dispatchers**: Standardized way to modify state
- **Persistence Layer**: Sync with localStorage for session persistence

## Routing
Client-side routing will handle navigation without page reloads:

- **Path-based Routing**: Map URLs to component views
- **History API**: Leverage browser history for navigation
- **Route Guards**: Protect routes that require authentication
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components only when needed

## Assets Management
Strategy for handling static resources:

- **Audio Optimization**: Format conversion for compatibility and size
- **Audio Analyzers**: Waveform and spectrum visualization
- **Stem Management**: Organizing related audio components
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer loading non-critical audio resources
- **Progressive Audio Loading**: Stream increasing quality levels
- **Font Loading**: Efficient web font loading with fallbacks
- **Audio Streaming**: Optimized formats with adaptive bitrates
- **Upload Management**: Chunked and resumable uploads

## Styling Architecture
Approach to styling components:

- **CSS Variables**: For theming and consistent design language
- **Component-Scoped Styles**: Using Shadow DOM encapsulation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- **Animation System**: Performance-optimized transitions

## Utilities
Helper functions and services:

- **API Client**: Wrapper for making backend requests
- **Audio Processing**: Client-side audio manipulation utilities
- **Upload Helpers**: Handle file selection and upload process
- **ID3 Parser**: Extract metadata from audio files
- **Waveform Generator**: Create visual audio representations
- **Date Formatting**: Consistent date display
- **Form Validation**: Input validation helpers
- **Media Helpers**: Audio/video processing utilities
- **Authentication**: Token management and session handling
- **Genre Hierarchy Utilities**: Working with nested genre trees, ancestry paths, and genre relationships
- **Rating Calculator**: Aggregate and display ratings
- **Attribution Utilities**: Handle proper credit and linking for remixes and stem usage
- **Relationship Visualization**: Generate graphs of track lineage and stem usage
