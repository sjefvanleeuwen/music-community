# Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy
Organizing code changes:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/xxx**: Individual feature development
- **bugfix/xxx**: Bug fixes
- **release/x.x.x**: Release preparation
- **hotfix/xxx**: Production emergency fixes

## Feature Development Process

### 1. Issue Creation
- Create GitHub issue with detailed requirements
- Add appropriate labels and milestone
- Discuss implementation approach in comments

### 2. Branch Creation
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

### 3. Implementation
- Follow coding standards and patterns
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### 4. Local Testing
- Run unit tests: `npm test`
- Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- Run e2e tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Test manually in development environment

### 5. Code Quality Checks
- Run linting: `npm run lint`
- Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- Fix formatting: `npm run format`
- Check for security vulnerabilities: `npm run security`

### 6. Pull Request
- Create PR against develop branch
- Fill out PR template
- Link related issues
- Request review from team members

### 7. Code Review
- Address reviewer comments
- Update implementation as needed
- Ensure CI checks pass
- Get final approval

### 8. Merging
- Squash and merge to develop
- Delete feature branch
- Verify deployment to staging environment

## Release Process

### 1. Release Preparation
- Create release branch: `release/x.x.x`
- Update version numbers
- Generate changelog
- Run full test suite

### 2. Release Candidate
- Deploy to staging environment
- Perform QA testing
- Fix any critical issues

### 3. Production Release
- Merge to main branch
- Create version tag
- Deploy to production
- Monitor application health

### 4. Post-Release
- Notify team and stakeholders
- Document any issues or learnings
- Merge release branch back to develop

## Bug Fixing Process

### 1. Bug Reporting
- Create issue with detailed reproduction steps
- Add priority label
- Assign to appropriate team member

### 2. Bug Fix Implementation
- Create bugfix branch
- Implement fix with test coverage
- Verify fix resolves the issue

### 3. Review and Deployment
- Follow PR process for review
- Merge to appropriate branches
- Deploy according to severity

## Code Review Guidelines

### What to Look For
- Functionality: Does it work as expected?
- Architecture: Does it follow project patterns?
- Performance: Are there potential bottlenecks?
- Security: Any potential vulnerabilities?
- Accessibility: Does it meet WCAG standards?
- Tests: Proper coverage of functionality?
- Documentation: Clear and comprehensive?

### Providing Feedback
- Be specific and actionable
- Explain reasoning behind suggestions
- Distinguish between requirements and preferences
- Acknowledge good solutions
- Use a collaborative tone

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Checks
- Test execution
- Linting and formatting
- Type checking
- Bundle size monitoring
- Accessibility testing
- Security scanning
- Performance benchmarking

### Deployment Pipeline
- PR deployments for feature testing
- Staging deployments from develop
- Production deployments from main
- Rollback capability for all environments
